DevOps and Agile are two different but complementary approaches that aim to improve software development and delivery processes. While they have distinct focuses, they can work together to create a more efficient and collaborative software development environment. Here's a comparison between DevOps and Agile:

**Agile:**

1. **Focus:** Agile is a software development methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. It focuses on delivering functional software in small, frequent releases.

2. **Principles:** Agile is based on the Agile Manifesto, which includes values like individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.

3. **Methodologies:** Agile includes various methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP), each with its own practices and roles.

4. **Iterations:** Agile projects are divided into short iterations called sprints. Each sprint typically lasts 1-4 weeks, during which a small set of features is developed, tested, and delivered.

5. **Roles:** Agile teams consist of cross-functional members (developers, testers, designers, etc.) and include roles like Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.

**DevOps:**

1. **Focus:** DevOps is a set of practices that aims to bridge the gap between development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It focuses on automating and streamlining the software delivery process and enhancing collaboration between development and operations teams.

2. **Principles:** DevOps principles include automation, collaboration, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous monitoring.

3. **Goals:** The primary goals of DevOps are to improve deployment frequency, achieve a faster time to market, lower failure rates of new releases, shorten lead time between fixes, and improve mean time to recovery.

4. **Practices:** DevOps practices include infrastructure as code (IaC), automated testing, continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and continuous monitoring.

5. **Team Structure:** DevOps promotes a cultural shift where developers and operations work closely together, often forming cross-functional teams, to ensure that code is developed, tested, and deployed smoothly.

**Relationship and Collaboration:**

- **Agile and DevOps Collaboration:** Agile focuses on the development process, while DevOps focuses on the entire software delivery pipeline, from development to deployment and operations. DevOps extends Agile principles to the operations and maintenance phases, emphasizing collaboration between development and operations teams.

- **Shared Values:** Both Agile and DevOps share values of flexibility, customer-centricity, collaboration, and a focus on delivering value to end-users.

In summary, Agile and DevOps are two related but distinct approaches that can work together to create a more efficient and effective software development and delivery process. Agile emphasizes iterative development and customer collaboration, while DevOps focuses on automating and streamlining the entire software delivery lifecycle, from development to operations.
